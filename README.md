# JS Challenge by Lighthouselabs

This is the progress I made from the day 13 on the 21 Day JavaScript Challenge by Lighthouselabs.


### How To Run It

To run my code I just used Node to run it in the Terminal on my laptop. Just edit at the end of the code the console.log line to call the function you want to test.
And then, to execute the file from the Terminal just type:

```
$ node main.js
```
